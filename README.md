# Finsight
This Finsight is a web application designed to perform text analysis on 10-K filings of various companies using Flask for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend. The backend retrieves 10-K filings data from the SEC website, while the frontend allows users to input a company ticker symbol and receive insights generated from the analysis.

Description
This project is a web application that allows users to analyze 10-K filings of companies listed on the stock market. It consists of two main components: a Python backend built using Flask and a frontend interface created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
1. Download 10-K Filings: The backend component includes a script (download_10k.py) that allows users to download 10-K filings from the SEC website for companies such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and BlackRock (BLK).
2. Text Analysis: The backend analyzes the downloaded 10-K filings using natural language processing techniques to generate insights about emerging trends or strategic priorities in the filings. This analysis is performed using the Language Model API.
3. Web Interface: The frontend component provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter the ticker symbol of a company and click a button to analyze its 10-K filings. The interface displays the insights generated by the backend in real-time.

Task 1: Downloading 10-K Filings
Task Description
The first task involves selecting companies, downloading their 10-K filings from the SEC website, and automating the process using Python scripts.

Companies Selected
The following companies have been selected for analysis:

- JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Ticker: JPM)
- The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Ticker: GS)
- BlackRock, Inc. (Ticker: BLK)

Python Script (download_10k.py)
The download_10k.py script is used to download 10-K filings for the selected companies from the SEC website.

```python
import requests

def get_10k_filings(ticker, cik):
    filings = []
    url = f"https://data.sec.gov/submissions/{cik}.json"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        if 'filings' in data:
            for entry in data['filings']:
                if entry.get('form') == '10-K':
                    filing_url = entry.get('linkToHtml')
                    filings.append(filing_url)
            print(f"Found {len(filings)} 10-K filings for {ticker}")
            return filings
        else:
            print(f"No 'filings' data found for {ticker}")
            return None
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch data for {ticker}. Status code: {response.status_code}")
        return None

def download_10k_filings(ticker):
    cik_map = {
        'JPM': '0000019617',
        'GS': '0000886982',
        'BLK': '0001364742'
    }
    cik = cik_map.get(ticker)
    if cik:
        filings = get_10k_filings(ticker, cik)
        if filings:
            for i, filing_url in enumerate(filings, start=1):
                filename = f"{ticker}_10K_{i}.html"
                response = requests.get(filing_url)
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
                        f.write(response.content)
                    print(f"Downloaded {filename}")
                else:
                    print(f"Failed to download {filename}. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    else:
        print(f"Invalid ticker: {ticker}")
```

Steps to Run
Execute the download_10k.py script in a Python environment.
Enter the ticker symbol of the company when prompted.
The script will fetch and download the 10-K filings for the specified company.
Example Usage
Include screenshots or GIFs demonstrating how to run the script and the output obtained.

Task 2: Text Analysis
Task Description
The second task involves using a Flask backend and JavaScript frontend to perform text analysis on the downloaded 10-K filings and generate insights.

Backend Code (Flask)
The Flask backend (app.py) provides routes for analyzing the 10-K filings and serving the frontend interface.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Render the HTML template for the front-end code
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Frontend Code (HTML, JavaScript)
The frontend interface (index.html) allows users to input company ticker symbols and trigger the analysis process.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>10-K Analysis</title>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    
    <h1>10-K Analysis</h1>
    <label for="ticker">Enter the ticker symbol of the company (e.g., JPM, GS, BLK):</label>
    <input type="text" id="ticker" name="ticker">
    <button id="analyze-btn">Analyze</button>

    <div id="insights">
    </div>

    <script>
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $('#analyze-btn').click(function() {
                var ticker = $('#ticker').val();
                if (ticker.trim() === '') {
                    alert('Please enter a ticker symbol');
                    return;
                }
                
                $.ajax({
                    url: '/analyze', // Ensure that the URL matches the Flask route
                    type: 'POST',
                    contentType: 'application/json',
                    data: JSON.stringify({ 'ticker': ticker }),
                    success: function(response) {
                        if ('error' in response) {
                            alert(response['error']);
                        } else {
                            displayInsights(response);
                        }
                    },
                    error: function(xhr, status, error) {
                        alert('Failed to analyze 10-K filings');
                        console.error(error);
                    }
                });
            });

            function displayInsights(insights) {
                $('#insights').empty();
                $.each(insights, function(key, value) {
                    $('#insights').append(`<p><strong>${key}:</strong> ${value}</p>`);
                });
            }
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Steps to Run
Run the Flask server by executing python app.py in the terminal.
Open a web browser and navigate to the specified URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
Enter a company ticker symbol and click "Analyze" to generate insights.
Example Usage
Including screenshots demonstrating how to use the application and view the generated insights.
