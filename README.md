# Finsight
This Finsight is a web application designed to perform text analysis on 10-K filings of various companies using Flask for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend. The backend retrieves 10-K filings data from the SEC website, while the frontend allows users to input a company ticker symbol and receive insights generated from the analysis.
